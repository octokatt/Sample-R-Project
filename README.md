# Hello, Internet Strangers!

This project has all of my answers for the scenarios for the data science interview, both in markdown and pdf.

`kkennedy_scen1-4.pdf` and `kkennedy_scen1-4.md` are pdf and markdown documents of my answers, respectively.  The `.RHistory` and related files are from Scenario 4, and are included as both a just-in-case and to be organized.

As well, I've included the original reference document, `Data Science Exercise` as a reference, though I have not added the data out of fear of privacy concerns.

I hope you have as much fun reading this as I had creating it.  Feel free to reach out to me at katt@fatehold.com if you have any questions.
